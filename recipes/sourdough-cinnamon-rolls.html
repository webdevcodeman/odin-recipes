        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> There's nothing quite like a soft, fluffy cinnamon roll. Especially if it's a sourdough cinnamon roll!</p>
        <p>This cinnamon roll recipe combines the best of both worlds: the predictable convenience of fast-acting yeast with the deep nuanced flavors in sourdough.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g active white sourdough starter</li>
            <li>350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>50g wholemeal flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>50g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>200ml warm milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>50g butter, softened, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>150g light brown sugar</li>
            <li>125g butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
            <li>100g soft cheese</li>
            <li>150g icing sugar</li>
            <li>Â¼ tsp vanilla paste or extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure your starter is active - it should be nice and bubbly. If it isn't, feed it and wait until a tsp of the starter floats in warm water.</li>
            <li>Tip all the ingredients for the dough, except the butter, into a bowl and mix with your hands to form a shaggy dough - make sure all the flour from around the bowl is mixed in. Leave the dough in the bowl, covered with a damp cloth, for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Work the butter into the dough with 1 tsp salt. Once fully combined, tip the dough onto a surface and knead gently for 5 mins until smooth and springy. Form the dough into a ball and sit back in the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm-ish for 3-4 hrs until the dough has just about doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the filling by beating together the sugar, butter, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Set aside at room temperature to keep soft.</li>
            <li>Butter and line a square baking tin - smaller tins (20 x 20cm) will hold nine buns, larger tins (25 x 25cm) will hold 12. Tip the dough onto a floured surface and roll it to a rectangle roughly 50 x 25cm. Spread the filling over the rectangle so it's completely covered. Roll the dough along the long edge into a tight swiss-roll type sausage. Cut your dough into pieces and arrange them, spiral side-up, in the tin. Leave for 1 hr at room temperature, then cover and leave in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cover the tin with foil and bake on a baking tray (this will stop any leaking mixture dripping into your oven) for 30 mins, then remove the foil and bake for 10-15 mins more to brown slightly.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix the golden syrup with 1 tbsp boiling water. As soon as buns come out of the oven, brush them generously with the syrup, then leave to cool a little. Lift the buns out of the tin while still warm and leave to cool on a wire rack. To make the icing, beat the soft cheese, sugar and vanilla until thick but drizzly. Drizzle over the buns when completely cool.</li>
        </ol>
